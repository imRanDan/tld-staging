        <h2>Why Stage?</h2>
        <p>Staging is all about maximizing your profits and minimizing time on market.</p>
  
        <p>Staged homes spend 73% less time on the market, allowing you to sell faster than other non-staged properties. Even in the current seller's market, buyers appreciate a great first impression and are willing to pay more for it. Staging your home highlights its best features, masks it's "could be better" spots and increases its livability potential during showings.</p>

          <li>Staging Strategy: Specific recommendations to bring out the best in your property.</li>
          <li>Proposal: An outline of project costs and timelines.</li>
          <li>Staging/Showcasing: Setup and execution of the staging strategy.</li>

        <h2>What is the difference between decorating and staging?</h2>
        <p>The main difference between decorating and staging is intent. With staging, we place furniture and accessories with the intention to enhance home appeal for buyers. Distracting pieces are removed and repalced with items that will highlight theroom's functional value and livability which will help drive up ROI on your property.</p>

        <h2>How long does staging take?</h2>

        <p>Time estimates are given on a case by case basis given your unique needs. For example, the entire end-to-end process (view our process section for details) of a vacant home stage can take around 1 week.</p>

        <p>An occupied home stage end-to-end is more flexible and we are more integrative to your schedule, given you currently live at the property. The actual staging process can take between 4-8 hours. Initial de-cluttering and repairs should have been done before by the home owner before the staging takes place.</p>

        <h2>What happens if the staging items that I have rented are damaged during staging?</h2>

        <p>Clients are responsible for any inventory items left in their home, regardless of whether the property is occupied or vacant. Any damage to rental items or TLD merchandise will be billed at full replacement cost.</p>
